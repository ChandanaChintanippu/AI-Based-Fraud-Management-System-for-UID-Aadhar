# AI-Based-Fraud-Management-System-for-UID-Aadhar
The AI-Based Fraud Management System for UID Aadhaar leverages cutting-edge technologies 
like YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) 
to detect and prevent fraudulent activities involving Aadhaar documents. The system automates
the verification process by matching extracted data from uploaded Aadhaar cards with official
records, ensuring enhanced security and accuracy.

**Key Features**

**Real-time Document Verification:** Detects and verifies Aadhaar card authenticity by analyzing images and matching extracted data.

**YOLO-Based Object Detection:** Identifies and localizes relevant fields (name, address, UID, DOB, etc.) from Aadhaar images.

**OCR Integration:** Extracts textual data from images for further analysis and validation.

**Fraud Detection:** Cross-verifies extracted data with official databases to detect inconsistencies.

**Automated Matching Logic:** Matches UID, name, and address using rule-based algorithms to ensure accuracy.

**Report Generation:** Provides detailed reports on successful and failed matches, highlighting potential fraudulent cases.
